# Parcing and data analysis of podcasts.ru // Final project on course "Basics of programming in Python" (2021)
This is my final project on the course "Basics of programming in Python" I studied in 2021 in Higher School of Economics in Russia, Moscow. 
As result of this project, we collected all articles on the russian site "podcasts.ru", dedicated to podcasts, and analyzed some of their characteristics.
